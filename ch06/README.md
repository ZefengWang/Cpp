# Summary
Programs and programming become more interesting when you introduce statements that guide the program through alternative actions.(Whether this also makes the programmer more interesting is a point you may wish to investigate.) C++ provides the if statement,the if else statement,and the switch statement as means for managing choices.The C++ if statement lets a program execute a statement or statement block conditionally.That is,the program executes the statement or block if a particular condition is met.The C++ if else statement lets a program select from two choices which statement or statement block to execute.You can append additional if else statements to such a statement to present a series of choices.The C++ switch statement directs the program to a particular case in a list of choices.
