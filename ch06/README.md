# Summary
Programs and programming become more interesting when you introduce statements that guide the program through alternative actions.(Whether this also makes the programmer more interesting is a point you may wish to investigate.) C++ provides the if statement,the if else statement,and the switch statement as means for managing choices.The C++ if statement lets a program execute a statement or statement block conditionally.That is,the program executes the statement or block if a particular condition is met.The C++ if else statement lets a program select from two choices which statement or statement block to execute.You can append additional if else statements to such a statement to present a series of choices.The C++ switch statement directs the program to a particular case in a list of choices.  
C++ also provides operators to help in decision making. Chapter 5 discusses the relational expressions,which compare two values.The if and if else statements typically use relational expressions as test conditions.By using C++’s logical operators (&&,||,and !),you can combine or modify relational expressions to construct more elaborate tests. The conditional operator (?:) provides a compact way to choose from two values.  
The cctype library of character functions provides a convenient and powerful set of tools for analyzing character input.  
Loops and selection statements are useful tools for file I/O,which closely parallels console I/O.After you declare ifstream and ofstream objects and associate them with files,you can use these objects in the same manner you use cin and cout.  
With C++’s loops and decision-making statements,you have the tools for writing interesting,intelligent,and powerful programs.But we’ve only begun to investigate the real powers of C++.Next,we’ll look at functions.
